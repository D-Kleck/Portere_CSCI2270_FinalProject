The Labrynth
Summary: The program is a single-player game. In which, the player is a struct to keep track of how many markers have been placed, how many gems have been found, and how many lives are left. Inside the labrynth, which is a class, are gems, markers, and traps to keep the player guessing and moving around. For each turn the player encouters, the player will then have to decide which direction they want to turn, given their options, or turn around and go back to where they were. The player has a pretty good "memory" and will be able to remember his last 3 turns, and be able to go 3 turns back. After all 3 gems have been found, a door will open in which the player will finally be able to leave the labrynth and win the game. This will end the game, as well as, forcibly exiting or dying. Within the maze, the player will be able to drop struct markers, these markers are able to be written on to allow the player to give themselves explicit directions, they will also show where the player last came from, and the first route the player will choose after dropping the marker. A player can then pick up the marker and look at their instructions and figure out another path.
